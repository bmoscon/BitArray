Multi language Bit Array Library

The C++ version is in src/cpp/
the C++ test code is in test/

the Python version and its test code is in src/python/


The C++ versions allows each element in the bit array to be composed of more than one bit. Really its more of a bitfield array. 

The Python implementation is currently much more simplistic and allows each element to be of size 1 bit.
